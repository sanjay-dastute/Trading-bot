   - Take-profit optimization
   - Position sizing based on Kelly Criterion
   - Portfolio diversification using Modern Portfolio Theory

4. Zero-Loss Protection System:
   - Pre-trade Validation:
     * Multiple AI model consensus (LSTM, XGBoost, Random Forest)
     * Minimum 98% prediction confidence threshold
     * Market sentiment analysis confirmation
     * Technical indicator cross-validation

   - Active Trade Protection:
     * Real-time price movement validation
     * Immediate exit on pattern deviation
     * Dynamic stop-loss adjustment
     * Automated risk assessment every 5 minutes

   - Position Management:
     * Small initial position with scaling
     * Multiple take-profit levels
     * Partial profit booking at key levels
     * Risk-free position after 1% profit

   - Loss Prevention Rules:
     * No trading during high volatility
     * Automatic session stop on 2 consecutive losses
     * Maximum daily drawdown limit of 1%
     * Mandatory cool-down period after stops

### Profit Maximization Strategy
1. Entry Conditions:
   - AI confidence score > 98%
   - Minimum 3 indicator confirmations
   - Volume > 200% of 20-day average
   - Market trend alignment with all timeframes
   - Sentiment analysis confirmation
   - Risk-reward ratio minimum 5:1
   - Maximum potential loss < 0.5% of portfolio

2. Risk Mitigation:
   - Maximum position size: 2% of portfolio
   - Stop-loss: Dynamic based on volatility
   - Take-profit: 3:1 reward-to-risk ratio
   - Maximum drawdown limit: 5%

3. Exit Strategy:
   - Trailing stop-loss
   - Profit target achievement
   - AI signal reversal
   - Time-based exit rules
